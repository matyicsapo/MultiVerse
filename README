put musicfiles to MusicFiles (ony mp3 and flac are supported  for now, also only one with a bit depth of 16bits)

MultiVerse is basically an AudioSurf(check that out too, it's great: http://www.audio-surf.com/ ) clone for Windows.

Originally a highschool project.
It's more of a proof of concept (also it's in alpha) version.

Could use infinite amount of improvement mostly in optimization.

Lacks documentation but might have hungarian comments here and there.
You can always mail me if something's unclear though stuff below should get most questions answered.

Coded with Microsoft Visual C# Express 2010.

using XNA Game Studio 4.0 for graphics, input, application base
